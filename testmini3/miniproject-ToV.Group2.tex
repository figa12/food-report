\maketitle %project description
We will in our project make an application that functions as a digital cookbook. The user is able to search for recipes by different search functions: by ingredients and by the name of the recipe. Users can share the recipes with friends and relatives, it is also possible to favourite a recipe. Our application should also support conversion between the imperial and metric system to reach a larger audience. 
We want to create a thin client which does not perform a huge amount of calculation, this means that we can focus on testing the server and the communication layer in the client.
