Finding recipes for cooking online has been become easy with the vast amount of sites that offer them. This has also extended to the mobile platform, allowing the users to quickly find a recipe wherever they are. It is very easy to type in the recipe you want to make and it comes up with a list of ingredients and a step by step guide on how to cook the dish. 

The user does not always know exactly what dish they want to cook, but instead know which ingredients they have or what ingredients they want to use. 	

Being able to search for recipes based on ingredients the user already has allows them to customise their searching and receive a larger selection of dishes. It allows them to search based on items they already have in their kitchen, or based on items they know are about to go bad and they need to use. The user could also be in a situation where they see something on sale at the supermarket and quickly need to find out what dishes they can make using this ingredient.

With these problems in mind we have come up with the following problem statement for our project:

How can we take advantage of the mobile platform, in order to provide the user with relevant recipes based on specific ingredients, taking into consideration different restrictions.
