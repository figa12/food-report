Both internationalization and localization can give some problems because we want the application to be usable in all parts of the world. In internationalization aspects the data structure of the application must be designed in such a way that additional languages are supported. This can also cause several design issues, such as how to handle languages where the reading direction is from right to left or specific words being significantly longer or shorter between languages.
An example of a localization problem that can occur is the units of measurement. The Imperial system is used in the United States and the Metric system is used in most parts of the world, this proposes a problem of what unit of measurement to display the ingredients in on the recipes. Another localization problem could be that some type of meat is frown upon in some parts of the world, this could mean that we might have to consider which recipes we show in which countries.
