\section{Authentication}
We have not implemented our own sign in option, since it would require us to handle the user's passwords and other personal information.
By using a social media sign in In our application as a way of identify the user, we remove the security measures to the specific social media.
A crucial social media sign in option is Google+, Google recommends using the Google+ sign in for Android applications\todo{kilde?}, since the developer is able to gather information about the user through their Google+ account.
It makes sense to use the Google+ sign in since it is highly recommended by Google to have a Google account when using an Android device, if the user does not have a Google account the user has a limited use of their Android device.
The Google+ authentication is natively supported by Android and can be achieved seamlessly.
Other authentication methods can also be used, such as Facebook, Twitter etc. and could later be implemented.
