The first time the user opens up the application they are prompted with a navigation drawer, as seen on \autoref{fig:navdrawer}. The reason this is shown the first time the application is opened is to inform the user that it is available, as this is the tool they will be using to navigate between the different pages in the application. To indicate that the navigation drawer is available there are three horizontal lines and the application's icon in the top left corner of the page. This is the case throughout all the pages, where the navigation drawer is available. The navigation drawer is an overlay of the application content but not the action bar

The user opens the navigation drawer either by swiping from the left edge of the screen or by clicking the icon in the top left corner and it is closed either by clicking outside of the navigation drawer, by clicking the icon in the top right corner again, by swiping from right to left anywhere on the screen, or by pressing back.

The navigation drawer itself overlays the application, and is not a new page.
