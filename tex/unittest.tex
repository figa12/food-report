\section{Unit test}
The mobile application is designed to be a thin client that sends and recieves messages to and from the server. Because of this we have chosen to focus our testing on the server, if the server has a 100\% code coverage and all tests are satisfied, we only need to ensure that the mobile application sends a correct message, and we can guarantee that the result is correct.
The server layer consists of a class that handles all connection to the database, the goal is to achieve 100\% method coverage on this class.

To avoid corrupting the data that is running on production we have made a script that makes an exact copy of the database to perform all of the testing on. The copying of the database could prove to be a bottleneck if the application were to get very big, but at the in current state it only takes a few seconds.

The unit tests are run using ``PHPUnit'' version 3.6.10 by Sebastian Bergmann,\todo{CITE: http://phpunit.de/} furthermore mutation tests are run using ``judgedim/mutagenesis''\todo{CITE: https://github.com/judgedim/mutagenesis}.

To demonstrate how we have performed the unit tests, the tests \inline{testSetRecipe()} and \inline{testGetRecipe()} have been included. These tests ensure that when a new recipe is written to the database, the exact same recipe can be retrieved again with no missing data.

    public function testSetRecipe($unit, $ingredient) {
        $url = 'http://localhost/food/lib/recipebackend.php';

        $fields = array(

\begin{description}
\item[Lines 2-3] The test depends on both \inline{testSetUnit()} and \inline{setSetIngredient}, we need both ingredients and a unit of measurement to create a recipe.
\item[Line 4] We specify that this test covers the \inline{setRecipe()} method in the \inline{DB} class. This is because the code coverage analysis tool does not properly detect coverage when using cURL.\todo{CITE: http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.curl.php}
\item[Line 6] \inline{testSetRecipe()} takes two parameters: the id of the inserted unit of measurement from \inline{testSetUnit()} and the id from \inline{testSetIngredient()} respectively.
\item[Line 7] The \inline{$url} variable is initialised to the value address of the file that handles creation of recipes. \textit{recipebackend.php} is used by the recipe creator tool.%$
\item[Lines 9-21] An array is initialised with key value pairs that represent the POST variables that is send to the given url.
\item[Line 23] The request is send to the server with the given POST variables and the result is stored in \inline{$result}.%$
\item[Line 24] It is checked that the result is not null. If the result were null it would mean that something went wrong while inserting the data.
\item[Lines 26-27] The id of the newly inserted recipe must be greater than 0.
\item[Line 29] Return the id of the insert recipe. This id is used by the \inline{testGetRecipe()} method to check that we can extract the recipe correctly again.

\begin{lstlisting}
    /**
     * @depends testSetRecipe
     */
    public function testGetRecipe($recipeId) {
        $jsonResult = self::$DB->getRecipe($recipeId, $this->language, $this->metric);
        $recipe = json_decode($jsonResult);

        //Check that the recipe is equal to the one we inserted.
        $this->assertEquals($recipeId, $recipe->id);
        $this->assertEquals($this->recipeName, $recipe->name);
        $this->assertEquals($this->recipeDesc, $recipe->desc);

\item[Lines 2] The test depends on \inline{testSetRecipe()}.
\item[Line 4] \inline{testGetRecipe()} takes the id that was returned from \inline{testSetRecipe} as a parameter.
\item[Lines 5-6] The method to get a recipe is called from the \inline{DB} class, and the result is JSON decoded. This enables us to handle the result as a PHP object.
\item[Line 7] The \inline{$url} variable is initialised to the value address of the file that handles creation of recipes. \textit{recipebackend.php} is used by the recipe creator tool.%$
\item[Lines 9-19] Numerous assertions are made to ensure that the data in the fetched object is equal to the data we used when writing the recipe to the database.
