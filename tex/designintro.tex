\todo{Mere intro}

The reader is expected to be familiar with standard Android components. Some components are briefly explained here:
\begin{description}
\item[Activity] An activity is a single focused thing that the user can do. You can also say that it is a window which is either full-screen or floating. \citep{activity}
\item[Fragment] A fragment inherits from activity and thus has its own lifecycle. Fragments are nested in activities, and can be used to build a multi-pane user interface. \citep{fragment}
\item[Action Bar] The action bar is a window feature that identifies the user location, and provides user actions and navigation modes. It is located at the top of the screen. \citep{actionbar}
\end{description}

However we are also referring to activities and fragments as pages, this is because it is irrelevant to the context what kind of implementation is used.
