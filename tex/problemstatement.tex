Finding recipes for cooking online has been become easy with the vast amount of sites that offer them. This has also extended to the mobile platform, allowing the users to quickly find a recipe wherever they are. It is very easy to type in the recipe you want to make and it comes up with a list of ingredients and a step by step guide on how to cook the dish. 

Some sites and applications even offer that you type in the ingredients you want to include in the recipe and it comes up with suggestions on what you can makes, however these websites often have one a flaw since it priorities the recipes which you have all the ingredients for, not taking into  account what ingredients you use or how many of the selected ones you use\citep{supercook}. The problem with this is if you want to make a dish containing both egg and chicken breast, you first have to scroll through all the recipes containing only eggs, making it tedious to find a suitable recipe. 

You are also able to put restrictions on recipes, for example if you are allergic to nuts it will exclude all recipes containing nuts, even if you put nuts as an ingredient.

Some sites also give the user suggestions for other ingredients they might have that go well with the ones already put in, allowing them to find a broader variety of recipes.  

With these functionalities in mind we have come up with the following problem statement for our project:
