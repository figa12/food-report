During the early stages of the project we began searching for existing solution to draw inspiration to the design and implementation phases. Almost all of us have had experience using different recipe sites on the Internet, and we all think that their searching implementation lacks functionallity. The best searching recipe website we found is called ``http://supercook.com/''\cite{supercook}



We want to make it easier for the user to find the correct recipe.
