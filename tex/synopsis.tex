The focus of the project is making an application that gives the user quick access to cooking recipes.

It is possible to search for recipes by their ingredients as well as their name and description. While searching for recipes by ingredients, a word cloud aids the user with suggestions for ingredients that could be included in the search.

The main motivation behind the application is that the users should be able to easily and quickly find recipes that include certain ingredients.

The user is able to login using their Google+ profile enabling their to favourite recipes. This allows the user to quickly rediscover recipes that are to his liking.
