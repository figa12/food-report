The focus of the project is making an application that will give the user quick access to cooking recipes.

The searching of recipes can be done with free-text, but is also supported by a searching algorithm that is based on ingredients as well as a word cloud that gives suggestions of ingredients to search by.

The main motivation behind the application is that the users should be able to easily and quickly look up recipes that include certain ingredients that fits the user's taste.

The user is able to login using his Google+ profile enabling him to favourite recipes. This allows the user to quickly rediscover recipes that are to his liking.
