Things to tell him: The report, and that we are now done with the analysis sprint.
What does he think of the current report any corrections:

Remarks(rettelser):
Introduction (some context should be provided)
The design chapter - should not start with screenshot(you describe what you do, but not why you do it, to show that you have reflected about it, and just don't work) - More architecture.


Ramin wants next next time we meet:
Try to make a more detailed plan(milestones)
