\maketitle

\section*{Section 1}
% a brief description of your initial project idea at the start of the semester (no more than half a page).

\section*{Section 2}
% work-products from using Essence. You can use results from the exercises, but you may also use later material from your project work. The work-products must relate to all four Views in Essence: Paradigm (scenarios, states, prototype), Product (design ideas, technological options), Project (Toulmin structure, other representations of visions, research visions, feature list), and Process (SWOT evaluation and one or both of these: value analysis, use criteria). Work-products in italics are recommended but not mandatory. Provide enough information in this section to illuminate and substantiate your observations in the rest of the presentation.



\section*{Section 3}
% description of how your results developed from your initial project idea (the problem you started out to solve) to status at the time of writing this mini-project. Were there any important leaps in your visions, product ideas, or perceptions of use context?


\section*{Section 4}
% theoretical evaluation
