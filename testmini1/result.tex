\item[Navigation drawer] This test was a success. All pages opens when clicked in the navigation drawer. Except for the \textit{Sign in} button, it signs you in instead of opening the sign in page.
\item[Recipe search] This test was a success. Searching for \textit{cream} returned two recipes. One of the recipes did not contain cream in the name of the recipe, this is because it also searches for recipes with the word \textit{cream} in its description.
