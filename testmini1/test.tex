We have created some black-box test cases for our Android application. We are performing the tests ourselves, we do this in order to test that all the different functionality requirements are working and producing correct results.

All test cases are presented in the form of a case header consisting of the case name, objective of the test, preconditions for the test, and the requirement we are satisfying. After the header we have made a procedure describing the steps that should be performed in the case and for each step we have a success criteria describing the expected outcome of the step.\todo{man behøver vel ikke skrive at test cases blev lavet tidligt i projektet? Det giver så meget mening}
